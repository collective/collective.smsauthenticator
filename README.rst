`Two-step verification <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-step_verification>`_
for Plone 4 with use login codes sent by SMS. This app allows users to enable
the two-step verification for their Plone accounts. A mobile phone capable to
receive SMS messages is obviously required. Usage of two-step verification is
optonal, unless site admins have forced it (configurable in app control panel).
Admins can white-list the IPs, for which the two-step verification would be
skipped.

===============
- Mobile phone which is able to receive SMS messages.
- Plone 4 (tested with Plone >= 4.3.1)

Limitations
===========
Note, that two-step verification works only for Plone users and does not work
for Zope users (those added with "./bin/instance" adduser command).
